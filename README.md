# svelte todo app

This is a todo app that I've created to learn working with Svelte 3.

## Try it out

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alveshelio/svelte-todo-example.git
```

...then

```bash
cd svelte-todo-example
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.

The app saves the todos to the local storage
The design is heavily "inspired" (copied) from this project: <http://svelte-todomvc.surge.sh>
